Minor improvements
==================
 - Support for multi-column formatting in WiKi (good alignment modes)
 - Support image-maps in WiKi
 - Datetime picker is ugly, find replacement (dhtmlx). Besides, Datetime picker 
 produces current time in local timezone. Should be UTC instead. Requirements:
    a) Allow easily selection of intervals from - to, like some air companies do
    b) Straight forward way of selecting time (without need to update date afterwards)
    c) Open correct month/year page, not current one
 - Y-value precision of big numbers under high zooms (500.000000000001) should
 be implemented using string arithmetics. Negative numbers should be considered,
 see implementation at php code.
  a) window.js/SetCustomAxis/*.toPrecision - increase from 7 to something....
  b) implement computations using string arithmetics
 - The detector name should appear on the plot after ASEC: We can implement it 
 with configurable callback to display information.
 - Allow to request data from cache in get_data service. Based on this do the 
 joining of archived databases to present continious data flow.
 - Allow limited enforcement of resolutions in graph and views (both increasing
 and decreasing)
 - At the moment we are reseting the mask/experiment/window properties after 
 LogGroup have been changed. We should try to use current 
    a) window/interval if they are inside the range.
    b) Preserve "all" mask (and named masks as well if they exists for both groups)

Version 0.0.9 (Custom visualization and export)
=============
 A. Implement interface to provide custom visualization modes 
  - Port RRD custom visualization mode
  - Visualization of time series in % relative to mean value estimated by 
  previous hour (resolution interval).
  - Plots including simple statistics: mean, variance, relative arror
  - In single channel mode, draw MIN-MAX-MEAN-?
 B. PNG export customization

Version 0.0.10 (Persistent customizations)
==============
A. Basic user support
B. Metainformation caching
 1. Cache all names in ADEI database
 2. Cache axes
 3. Allow editing of the names
C. MASK/Experiment Editor
 1. Include Save Mask, Save Time Window buttons (We need to update SOURCE and 
    MENU if new mask/experiment is added)
 2. Mask / Experiment editor. It should be allowed to delete mask, alter its
    name, view included items (possibly allowing deletion)
 3. Support for mask properties, allowing selection of special ways of display

Version 0.0.11 (Interface improvements)
==============
A. Better Graph Navigation
 - Activate / deactivate Axis, do mouse zooming only on active ones
 - Move current window using keyboard keys
 - Move left-rigth/up-down then dragging on the axis. 
 - Near borders of graph remove the control from the croper, change pictogram 
 to 'hands' and allow moving source_window currently on display.
 - Shading will redrawing
 - If we had selcted an area of graph and afterwards have adjusted the 
 configuration in sidebar, the selection is canceled. It would be nice 
 to check if new values are within the currently displayed window and, 
 if so, adjust selection instead.
B. Legend
 - Information about clicked location
 - Add "Show Only", "Remove" buttons.
C. Navigation Bar
 - Allow selection of navigation modules. The default "navigator" illustrates
 recordings density (red - green?), with special color highlight the places 
 where are distance between points exceeding specified threshold (missing
 data).
 - Use the cropper for navigation, but fixed width (defined by currently 
 selected window) and always visible
D. Interface improvements
 - Hide some sidebar/control tabs depending on the selected page

VERSION 0.0.12 (Analysis Interface)
==============
A. DVIN style analysis interface
 - Using selection interface export the data into the analysis module 
 using specified resolution.
 - Do  operations on exported time series: add, substract, and multiply 
 by constast

VERSION 0.0.13 (Views)
==============
A. Interface
 - Visualize Multi-dimensional time series based using video playback. 
 In appropriate box of left pane, we will have a picture and slider 
 allowing navigation. About 10-50 positions distributed uniformely 
 over the selected time. On each position the first item after 
 time is displayed. The timestamp is shown on as well.
B. Implementations
 - Displacement search view
 - Integral under selected part of graph

VERSION 0.0.14 (Tagging)
==============
 - Using selection add tags. Tag consists of type (a value from predefined 
 list), and custom text. Examples of types: Comment, Invalid data, Recache, 
 etc.
 - Some marks then may be used by ADEI system scripts to do some maitenance.
 For example, - recaching marked segments. Or more complex variant, - the 
 marked segments should be processed with certain filters (and hence re-
 cached aferwards). For this case, we should be able to provide some 
 parameters with mark type as well.
 - Integrate tagging module with search engine. Additionaly, it should be
 possible to find all tags for the data currently on display.

Version 0.0.15 (Search improvements)
==============
 - Search for intervals where conditions (<>=) are met (only aggregated 
 caching tables are used)
 - Autogenerate experiments by thresholding some of the channels (using
 specified above feature)
 - In case of item search, add addition button to add found item into the 
 virtual tree.
 - "Jan" find all Januaries containing data and auto-select the current 
 one
 - Buttons to Open/Close result descriptions and module results

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

VERSION 0.1 (Multitouch)
===========
 1. Finish multitouch interfaces for iPhone / iPad / Android versions

VERSION 0.2 (Aggregation and Caching)
===========
 1. Split large groups into the multiple cache tables. Due to colum limit in the
 mysql (other databases are limited as well), the maximum number of items per
 group is currently limited by ~500 (assuming 3 cache columns per channel).
 2. Interface for managing custom caches. For instance,
  - MEDIAN style approach. On each smalles caching interval it is MEDIAN. Then
  the middle of this intervals select to represent value of next caching 
  level. And so on.
  - ALTERNATIVE MEAN could be over items, or over length (considering that the 
  old value is valid until next one).
 3. Tere is different types of channels: analog, count rate, digital (flags), 
 direction. This data should be aggregated and displayed
 in different ways. For example, 
    a) 355grad and 5grad should not be averaged to 180, but to 0
    b) digital flags could not be averaged at all.
 4. Support for Subcaches (if density is above threshold use apporpiate 
 subcache). Join current table and subcache to automatically sort.
 5. Support for 'omit_raw_cache' option (using READER instead of raw cache table)
 Intended to reduce caching table size if connection to data source is reliable
 and it is not overloaded

Version 0.3 (Status Display)
=============
1. Control infastracture
 - Finalyze checking of values prior to setting setpoints
 - Implement VirtualControlGroup joining specified control groups, to 
 refer from ExpressVI
2. Real-time infrastructure
 - CACHE updating daemon and check renewals
 - Real-time display of the last 100-200 records [separate window]
3. GUI for fast prototyping of status displays

Version 1.0 (Code style)
===========
 1. require, include_once => $ADEI->RequireClass(array(), overridable)
 2. globals => $ADEI->GetGlobalOption
 3. Remove references(&) from all class variables
 4. Use static ADEI calls where possible
 5. Standartize error handling in JS scripts: Throw from async parts? And call 
 adeiError in all others? Use "translate" calls everythere.
