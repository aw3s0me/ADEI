 Apache CONFIGURATION
 --------------------
 - It is good idea to allow overriding apache configuration in .htaccess files.
 You will need to set 'AllowOverride' directive within apache2 configuration
 for the ADEI directory.
    AllowOverride All
 
 PhP CONFIGURATION
 -----------------
 - The configuration of both mod_php (normally in /etc/php/apache2-php5/php.ini)
 and command line client (/etc/php/cli-php5/php.ini) should be set.
 
 - The php should ignore E_NOTICE (default behaviour). The E_NOTICE reporting
 could be enabled in php.ini by "error_reporting = ..." statment. Set it to
    error_reporting = E_ALL & ~E_NOTICE

 - The short open tag "<?" should be enabled. Add
    short_open_tag = On
    
 - If application is working with big amounts of data, you probably need to
 increase maximal execution time of scripts (afterwards they are killed), and
 maximum amount of memory script can utilize.
    max_execution_time = 300
    memory_limit = 1024M
    
 - Alternatively it is possible to set this values in .htaccess file. To do
 so, the 'AllowOverride' directive within apache configuration should be set 
 to 'Options' or 'All'.

 JpGraph CONFIGURATION
 ---------------------
 - JpGraph requires 'arial.ttf' and other MS true type fonts for it operation.
 By default it looks them in '/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/truetype'. 
 The location could be adjusted in 'jpg-config.inc.php', 'TTF_DIR' variableÀ
 
 - JpGraph sometimes reports errors (for example, arial.ttf not found error)
 in a very strange manner: It prints incomplete PNG on standart output (even
 if it is not asked for a graph yet or it should create a graph in a file).

 FreeTDS CONFIGURATION
 ---------------------
 - The FreeTDS should be compiled with unixODBC and MSDBLib support. The TDS
 version should be set to 7.0. The following configure line will do the job
    ./configure --with-unixodbc=/usr --enable-msdblib --with-tdsver=7.0
 a) You may need to correct the path where unixODBC is actually installed.
 b) The FreeTDS version should mandatory set. You will get very strange effects
 while it configured to other value (4.2 for example)

 ODBC CONFIGURATION
 ------------------
  - For MSSQL Support:
    a) create 'tds.driver.template' with following content
	[FreeTDS]
	Description     = v0.64 with protocol v8.0
	Driver          = /usr/lib64/libtdsodbc.so.0
    b) you may need alter driver path, to place libtdsodbc.so is actually
    residing.
    c) register driver in odbc
	odbcinst -i -d -f tds.driver.template
    
 ADEI CONFIGURATION
 ------------------
  - 'tmp' directory should be writable by apache
