Browser Specific
================
 Opera (9.25): 
    - Slow JS script handling: Selection, Window movements
    - Centring for popup labels is not working
    - Status-bar border is rendered wrong. This is fixed in version 9.27

 IE6:
    - If legend (and other dialog) window is resized to very small size, IE6
    hides end part of titlebar background.
    - Then dialog window is over 'SELECT' form items, it's edges are damaged.
    This is because in IE6 the z-index is ignored for 'SELECT' and the used fix
    utilizes iframe to get rid of. But if iframe would be made to big it will
    prevent dialog resizing. So the edges are sacrificed to the resizing.
	+ Still the bug in some conditions (not tracked at the moment) still
	introduces itself in full his mighty.
    - There is some bug with determining offset(Width,Left,Height,Top), which
    results in missposition elements on few pixels. To neglect effects, you
    could edit adei.js/UpdateModuleGeometry and substract few pixels in w/h
    calculation. However, could be just ignored.
    - IE6 doesn't support sibling selectors in CSS, which prevents some
    optimizations of elements placement.

 IE:
    - IE ignores CSS construct ':before { content: "{" }. Therefore, there is
    no better then color indictation of the currently selected source module.
    - Sometimes IE resizes Legend dialogs in that way that its width slightly 
    shorter than necessary and therefore the vertical scrollbar is appeared.
    - When the 'SELECT' element have big titles which are not fitting in
    the allocated space, the good browsers (Gecko, Safari, Opera) on 'select' 
    action resize popup window to full width. The IE doesn't. So only the 
    starting part of the titles is visible.
    - Menu is opening under dialog windows due to the invalid z-index handling

 KONQ3:
    - Not working at all
    - Konqueror 3 is reported to not support mouse wheel events
 

Server Side
===========
 - Please, look in 'mysql.txt' and 'mssql.txt' for database specific problems
 and required fixes.
