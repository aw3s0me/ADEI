    addeded callback function to notify about value changes (onchange event
    is not emited if the input field is altered by JS)

cropper:
    major feature enchancements to provide application with much more 
    information on user interactions.

dhtmlHistory(rsh):
    In the original version there is certain problems with Internet Explorer,
    for example: http://code.google.com/p/reallysimplehistory/issues/detail?id=33
    
    There is some fixes, still certain problems in non-gecko browsers are still
    possible:
    1) I expect were could be problem if we are going back before new location
    is stored.


BROWSERS
========
 IE 6,7:
    - If durign event processing we call removeChild on the element associated
    with event, then IE will afterwards ignore keydown (and probaly some other
    events) until we click on the browser window.
    
    Actually, the problem was: We click on Apply button of selection and 
    afterwards IE ignores all key modifiers until we click in.
