FUNCTIONS
=========
 Overall:
    - Clicking on buttons on the left side of image will open various
    controls:
	1) Various graphic options
	2) Source of the data: database, data group, etc
	3) Data export settings
    - Mentioned above buttons may had special pictograms allowing fast
    access to the encompassed options, allowing basic operations without
    opening full controls.
    
 Graph:
    - Holding left mouse key it is possible to select area. Afterwards the
    selection area could be adjusted and shifted. Besides that it is possible
    to select:
	+ Only timeframe leaving the allowed value-range untouched. To achieve
	that, please, select area with only a few pixels height.
	+ Only accepted value range leaving the timeframe untouch. To achieve
	that, please, slect area with only a few pixels width.
    Following actions can be pefrormed with selection:
	+) Zoom: by double clicking within the selction, or by clicking
	on apply button attached to the selection.
	+) Export: Export the data within selection using current export 
	settings. Achieved by clicking on export button attached to the
	selection.
	+) Cancel: To cancel selection just click with a mouse somethere 
	outside of the selection.
    - By clicking on the graphic it is possible to get information about
    data items displayed (and alter items mask: display only selected items
    or remove selected items from display).
	+ The mentioned information is shown in popup window which could be 
	moved and resized. If it's moved, the folowing clicks will alter
	content in the window but not window position and size.
	+ To enable again size and possition auto-adjustment the window
	should be closed by clicking "close" button in the left-upper
	angle.
	+ The second button in the angle will maximize window.
    - Changing certain parameters (for example items, non-by-item masks, 
    display window size) will automaticaly apply configuration. The rest
    of the parameters should be manually applied.
    - The graphic is pereodically auto-updated to display newly obtained
    data (update rate is specified in the server configuration).
    - The accuracy of the graph is highly dependent on amount of the data
    items and may varry from 1 to appr. 100 pixels (actual values are
    specified in the server configuration).
    - Zooming time window in and out could be done with mouse wheel.

 History:
    - The history is only updated if the graph (or some equivalent on other
    pages) is changed. The alteration of EXPORT setting will be ignored by
    history (but they will be reflected in the browser location).
    
    
TIME.
====
 In order to prevent problems with time, it is highly recommended:
    a) Set CACHE MySQL to GMT timezone
    b) Set C/en_US locale

DATABASES.
=========
 * MSSQL (Microsoft SQL Server)
    - The PDO(dblib) and mssql_* should not be used. The php driver is (5.2.4)
    really ugly. It obtains whole result dataset in internal buffer. 
    - The PDO(ODBC) driver works correctly.

 * ODBC
    - ODBC have some problems as well (both PDO and odbc_* versions):
     + It crashes when executed using mod_php, but works from php_cli
     + While executed with php_cli, the php is hang on exit
    this have been solved by 
     + using apache 2.2.6, instead of 2.0.x
     + removing -fPIC compilation flag
     + compiling into the php only odbc, pdo and mysql DB modules
   - Still there are in some circumstances quite strange behavior. The 
   'query' request could fail with error code '0' or just complaining what
   it could not prepare SQL request. 
     + This is a bug in PhP odbc(PDO/non-PDO) driver or in it interaction with
     FreeTDS odbc driver.
     + The problem looks to arise when a single connection tries to open
     second result set (two parallel queries exists) to the database.
     + Please, note that the following would trigger a error:
        while () {
	    $res = $odbc->Query();
	}
    and this not (since, in the first case connection closed after another is
    openned):
        while () {
	    $res = NULL;
	    $res = $odbc->Query();
	}
     + The problem is handled in database.php by converting resultsets to the
     arrays. We expect what all big queries are executed with Prepare.


MULTIPLE SETUPS
===============
 To use multiple configurations with single code base, it is necesary to
 enable "$SETUP_MULTI_MODE = true;" in the configuration.
 Afterwards, it is possible to specify required setup with
 a) '?setup=<setup_name>' - in the browser
 b) 'php -- -setup <setup_name>' - in scripts
