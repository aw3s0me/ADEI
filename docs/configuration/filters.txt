Filters
=======
LENGTHFilter - adds missing vector items and removes extra ones depending
    on configuration. The NULL values are used in place of missing values.
    Afterwards, items can be filtered out by NULLFilter or replaced with
    default values using NULLCorrector filter.
    Configuration:
    - remove_extra_items [boolean]
    - add_missing_items [boolean]
    - missing_value [double or NULL]
	value to use in place of missing ones, NULL by default
    - ignore_invalid_data [boolean] 
	do not generate exception on invalid data (just skipping). The data is
	invalid if amount of items is not fixed by that filter.

NULLFilter - checks the amount of NULLed (missing) values within the vector
    and depending on it, filltres the vector out or allows it in.
    Configuration:
    - use_missing_items [boolean]
	Use missing items parameter (supplied by precceding filter) instead of
	doing lookup for missing items by itself.
    - limit [integer]
	Limit amount of tolerable NULL values. 0 means that there should be no
	NULL values, and if not set any amount of 0 values is allowed.
    - minimal [integer]
	Sets minimal required amount of not-NULL values
    - check_growth [boolean]
	Check for non-decreasing number of items
    - check_precise [boolean]
	Make expansive checks to be completely sure
    - tolerate_at_end_only [boolean]
	Allow missing values at vector end only
    - filter_cache_reader [boolean]
	Apply filter even to CACHEReader source
    
NULLCorrector - replaces missing NULL values with default one.
    Paramters:
    - value [double]
	Replacement value


Standard Parameters
===================
masked	- MASK filter is already applied. Depending on READER (and its 
    configuration) the MASK filter could be applied on earlier stage. 
    This is optimization preventing extra data download. However, this could 
    cause certain filter malfunction.

resampled - Data resampling is done

limited - The vectors limit is applied


missing_items - Is an array describing missing (true) and present (false) items
    in the vector. Is normally generated by LENGTHFilter.
