Fomat of Search String
======================
 Basically, a search string consists of four components:
 a) the first component defines type of search (i.e. item search, channel value 
 search, datetime search)
 b) second component provides some options (i.e. exact match)
 c) the second and third are module dependent and containing search string
 and additional limits.
 
 - Format:
	 [module specification] [global flags] <search string> [limits]


Module Specification
====================
 {module_name(opt1=value1,opt2=value2),another_module(...)}
 
Global Options
==============
 [option1,option2]
 
 - Options
    =		Exact match
    w		Word match
    ~		Fuzzy match

Limits Specification
===================
 limit1: limit string limit2: limit string 
 
Search String Formats
=====================
 Title search (Item, Control, ...)
 ---------------------------------
     word1 word2 "phrase n" /regexp/

 - Match Modifiers
    ~ word			- fuzzy match, part of a word could be matched
    = word			- full match, only whole words are matched
 By default on search string "sin" the words "sin" and "sinus" will be matched
 but "cosinus" - not. However, if fuzzy search is given "~sin", the cosinus
 will be matched as well. If full match is required "=sin", only "sin" will
 be matched and nothing else.
	
 - Word rating modifiers  
 Certain modules may use ratings to indicate match quality.  The rating range
 is limited to [0,1]. By default if several words are specified in row, the
 ratings are multiplied. Example:
    word1 [0.70] word2 [0.30] word3[1]
 will produced integrated rating of '0.21'. However, the few unirary and binary
 operations could be used to adjust rating computations ([word] is a rating of
 word/phrase 'word')
    ! word 		The resulting rating will be (1-[word1])
    (word1|word2)	The maximal rating among listed words
    + word		All ratings below 1 will be cat to 0
    - word		All non-zero ratings will be cut to zero, zero rating
			will be replaced with 1
